The Scorched Lands are located on the side of the Brushwoods nearest to the star, the land is mostly desolate being covered in dry sandy dunes and rocky crags. The vast dunes are no place of solace.
## Access to the Scorched Lands
Finding your way to the dunes is no easy task in order to find yourself in sunlight you must dive deep into the caves of the Brushwoods. In the veiled abyss you can find Shadow root spires that have made their way through the bedrock and since been used by ancient ones as a form of transport to the other side of the planet.
## Ancient ones
The Noblins were the first to brave the abyss and live long enough to create settlements. This was long ago, now they guard remnants of their once strong presence in the abyss. They worship the vortex found in the spires, the Noblins view the spires as a holy place and idolize anyone who goes in and comes back.
## On the flip side
When you enter the vortex in the Veiled abyss you will find yourself deep in the caves still only you are now on the opposite side of the planet. The caves are relatively safe however when you venture to the surface you will be met with harsh climate, terrain, and territorial creatures.
