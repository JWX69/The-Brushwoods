Within the [[Veiled Abyss]] you will find these peculiar Shroudpods that are responsible for creating the dense and haunting fog that covers the world around them. Removing these bulbs will not dissipate the fog however harvesting the bulbs can yield unique items such as the Shroud Sac that allows you to craft an item that can be used to create a cloud of fog much akin to the fog found in the abyss.
