#biome
Welcome to the Rooted Enclave found in the [[Brushwoods Dimension]] , it's a place where nature intertwines with remnants of a forgotten civilization. As you step into this mystical biome, you'll find yourself immersed in a landscape dominated by a dense network of intricately woven roots. These gnarled and twisting tendrils rise from the ground, giving the impression of nature itself reclaiming the ancient ruins that lie scattered throughout.

Among these roots, you may stumble upon the remnants of ancient ruins made of [[Gloomstone]], remnants of a once-thriving civilization. Weathered and worn, These ruins stand as silent testaments to the stories and lives that once filled them.

[[Woodland Sprite]]'s rarely venture into the Rooted Enclave. Due to the fact they were banished from the civilization that now lies in ruins. However, some Woodland Sprites, driven by a desire to make amends, venture into the depths of the enclave. Despite their best intentions, they too often find themselves lost among the roots and ruins, unable to navigate their way back. These lost sprites eventually transform into [[Dull Sprite]]'s, their once-vibrant essence forever dimmed.

In the Rooted Enclave, nature's resilience intertwines with the echoes of history. It invites intrepid explorers to unravel the secrets held within its overgrown roots and weathered ruins, providing a glimpse into the interplay of life, time, and the enduring spirit of the natural world.
