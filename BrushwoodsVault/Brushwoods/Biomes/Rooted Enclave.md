#biome
Welcome to the Rooted Enclave found in the [[Brushwoods Dimension]] , it's a place where nature intertwines with remnants of a forgotten civilization. As you step into this biome, you'll find yourself in a landscape dominated by a dense network of intricately woven roots. These gnarled and twisting tendrils rise from the ground, giving the impression of nature itself reclaiming the ancient ruins that lie scattered throughout.

Among these roots, you will find ancient ruins made of [[Gloomstone]], remnants of a once-thriving civilization.

Woodland Sprites rarely venture into the Rooted Enclave. Due to the fact they were banished from the civilization that now lies in ruins. However, some Woodland Sprites, driven by a desire to make amends, venture into the depths of the enclave. Despite their best intentions, they too often find themselves lost among the roots and ruins, unable to navigate their way back. These lost sprites eventually transform into [[Dull Sprite]]s, their once-vibrant essence forever dimmed.
