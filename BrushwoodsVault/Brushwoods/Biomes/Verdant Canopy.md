This dense forest found in the [[Brushwoods Dimension]], has been mostly untouched by civilization due to its density and the wilderness that fills the forest. However, the [[Woodland Sprite]]s have found this biome to be perfectly suited for them due to their small size and ability to find cover in the canopies of the Elm trees.

The forest is relatively dark, but there are mushrooms that grow on the floor and sides of trees, these mushrooms glow and illuminate their surroundings. the larger mushrooms even emit small sparkly particles that add a mystical atmosphere to the biome.

These Woodland Sprites, curious and gentle by nature, may offer assistance, share secrets of the forest, or even exchange rare and precious items unique to the Brushwoods.
