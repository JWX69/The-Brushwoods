Woodland Sprites are social creatures that prefer to travel in groups called "choirs" within the Brushwoods.

Behavior: Woodland Sprites are highly social and communicate through a series of small whistling sounds. Their harmonious melodies fill the air as they navigate the Brushwoods, creating an enchanting atmosphere. They are generally peaceful and friendly, often approaching players out of curiosity and a desire for interaction.

Interaction: 

Choir Dynamics: The behavior of Woodland Sprites is influenced by their choir dynamics. Each choir has a unique personality, influencing their interactions with players and their surroundings. Some choirs may be mischievous some may be helpful leading players on whimsical quests or hiding valuable treasures. When a sprite is separated from its Choir or isolated for an extended period it becomes a [[Dull Sprite]]

Helping and Trading: Woodland Sprites should not be harmed or killed for loot. Instead, players are encouraged to help them or engage in friendly trades. Assisting a lost or distressed Woodland Sprite, such as guiding them back to their choir or fulfilling a specific request, can result in rewards or unique items being bestowed upon the player as a token of gratitude.

The sprites grow their young in top of head and then plant on tree branch when mature enough. When the egg/baby is grown enough it snaps off of the tree explaining why the top of their heads resemble a broken branch.
