The beast isn't real.

The veiled abyss is a dangerous place. but is it?
The beast isn't real
In the abyss you dont see much, desolate dunes of silt, barren trees and picked off bones. you may start to believe in totally unreasonable things... They are unreasonable right?!?
The beast isn't real...
are they still watching? no ok, watch out for it... it follows where ever you go down here, not sure what it is.
The beast isn't real,
if you think it found you, run...




-Possible forms-

- False Goat
<<<<<<< Updated upstream

Goblin guy ~
lurks around and watches you
blinks and initiates The Eyes effect of the beast
after it blinks poofs away in cloud of smoke
