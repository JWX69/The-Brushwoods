When a Woodland Sprite becomes lost or isolated for an extended period, it gradually transforms into a Dull Sprite. These Dull Sprites move slowly and with a melancholic demeanor, reflecting their diminished connection with their social group. However, they still wander throughout the Brushwoods, albeit in a more subdued manner.
